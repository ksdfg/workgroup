# Workgroup

![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/ksdfg/workgroup/Test?style=for-the-badge)

A small utility to manage the lifetime of a set of related goroutines.

Built as a replacement for [heptio/workgroup](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/heptio/workgroup), because that became an
internal library of some other repo, and most of the other libraries I found were nowhere as simple as this **(〒︿〒)**
